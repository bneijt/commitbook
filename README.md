Commit book
===========

_Create a foto album of your git commit snapshots_

Introduction
------------
I created a script to take a snapshot every commit.

Now I'm making a foto album from them.

Requires: number of pages you want, and all the picutures. Will then need to resize and stack them in
separate pictures so they can be put in a picture album and printed online.

13.3cm by 10cm booklet
530x397 pixels approximate ratio

Probably best size image is 3180x2382



Say 24 pages and about a 1000 pictures -> about 40 pictures a page. Dimensions are 3 to 4, leaving us with about a 6x8 matrix per page.
